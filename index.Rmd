## Stop and Frisks in DC
Stop and Frisk is the practice of temporarily detaining, questioning, and searching civilians on the street without probable cause [^1]. MPD is required by the law to record Stop and Frisks [^2]. However, there is reason to believe that many incidents of Stop and Frisk have not been recorded. MPD's data collection is the focus of [an ongoing lawsuit against Mayor Bowser and Police Chief Peter Newsham](https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/21004223/civil-rights-and-activist-groups-sue-bowser-over-stopandfrisk-data-collection). The lawsuit was brought by DC chapters of the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, and the Stop Police Terror Project.

## Who is Targeted by Stop and Frisk?
Reported Stop and Frisk incidents show a heavy bias towards young, black men. **93% of people stopped were non-white** [^3]. MPD has not released data on if stops lead to an arrest. Furthermore, we lack visibility into the reason for the stop or if those that were arrested were later found guilty of a crime.

#### By the numbers

```{r demog table}
incid %>% 
  arrange(if_else(Group=='Other', 1, 0), -`Stop and Frisks`) %>% 
  mutate(
    `Stop and Frisks` = color_bar("lightgreen")(`Stop and Frisks`)
  ) %>% 
  kable(escape = F) %>%
